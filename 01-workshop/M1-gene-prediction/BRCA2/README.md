Use AUGUSTUS to predict a human gene. Uses [NC_000013.11:32315077-32400268](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000013.11?report=fasta&log$=seqview&from=32315077&to=32400268) as the input. No cDNA or other hints are provided. None or few alternative transcripts. AUGUSTUS can be run either on their [old web server](https://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/submission.php), their [new web server](https://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/webaugustus/prediction/create), or on [GALAXY](https://usegalaxy.org). The output is in GTF format. The result can be visualized using the [IGV app](https://igv.org/app/). First upload the genome using local files. Must upload both the `fasta` and the index `fasta.fai` files together. Then upload the `gtf` file using the Track menu.

- The `AUGUSTUS.gtf` file in this folder was downloaded from GALAXY using the AUGUSTUS tool therein.
- The `RefSeq.gff` file in this folder was downloaded from NCBI under the NC_000013.11 record. The BRCA2 gene NM_000059.4 mRNA record was manually extracted, and an offset of 32315076 was subtracted from the start and end positions
- The `ORFfinder.gtf` file in this folder was copy-pasted from the output of the [ORF finder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/) tool, asked to predict open reading frames on NC_000013.11:32315077-32400268, with a minimal ORF length of 150 bp.
